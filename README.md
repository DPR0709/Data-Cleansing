# Data-Cleansing

Once you source the data, it is essential to get rid of irregularities in the data and fix its quality.


One can encounter different kinds of issues in a dataset. Irregularities may appear in the form of missing values, anomalies/outliers, incorrect format and inconsistent spelling, etc., These irregularities may propagate further and affect the assumptions and analysis based on that dataset and may hamper the further process of machine learning model building. Hence, Data cleaning is required.
